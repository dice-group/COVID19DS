    crip:description "Severe COVID-19 health risk index in 2020. PolicyMap created this index for the New York Times. It represents the relative risk for a high proportion of residents in a given area to develop serious health complications from COVID-19 because of underlying health conditions identified by the CDC as contributing to a person's risk of developing severe symptoms from the virus. These conditions include COPD, heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Estimates of COPD, heart disease, and high blood pressure prevalence are from PolicyMap's Health Outcome Estimates. Estimates of diabetes and obesity prevalence are from the CDC's U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System. The normalized score represents a sum of the share of the adult population ever diagnosed with each health condition. It should not be interpreted as a percentage of people affected by the five conditions, since these shares are not mutually exlusive; those diagnosed with two or more conditions count two or more times. Because these values are normalized by adult population, however, they can be used to compare overall risk between areas with different populations. Normalized scores were then converted to z scores. A county's z score shows how many standard deviations above or below the average a county's risk level falls. A score of 0.6, for example, would mean that the county has a higher risk than average, but is still within one standard deviation of the average and is therefore not unusually high. Risk categories are assigned based on z scores."^^xsd:string ;
